# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

I probably won't go to great lengths to make all of my code super tidy and well-documented (which makes me wonder
if it's worth putting up here at all), but I wrote a bunch of stuff just for fun and glory, so I thought it couldn't
hurt to leave it here.

Note: Each file can only be depended upon to produce the solution for part 2 because I often repurposed the part 1 code.
